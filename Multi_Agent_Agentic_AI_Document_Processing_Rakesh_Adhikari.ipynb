            "————————————————————————\n",
            "Risks\n",
            "• Penalty for delivery delays is capped at 10% of contract value, potentially limiting compensation for significant delays.\n",
            "• Legal ambiguity in the definition and scope of \"Force Majeure\" may lead to disputes over penalty exemptions.\n",
            "• Dispute resolution relies on amicable settlement and arbitration, which may delay enforcement of remedies.\n",
            "• Confidentiality obligations expire after 3 years post-termination, creating a potential security gap for sensitive information thereafter.\n",
            "• Subcontracting is permitted, which may introduce operational weaknesses if subcontractors do not meet quality or security standards.\n",
            "• No explicit technical safeguards or audit mechanisms for software components, increasing risk of undetected security vulnerabilities.\n",
            "• Acceptance testing and inspection are limited to a 10-day window, possibly missing latent defects or vulnerabilities.\n",
            "• Warranty excludes consumables, which may be critical to system operation and could be a point of operational weakness.\n",
            "• Tele-support and on-site response times are defined, but no penalties for failure to meet these deadlines, limiting enforcement.\n",
            "• Refunds upon termination are subject to deduction for completed work value, which may be open to interpretation and dispute.\n",
            "• No explicit provisions for data protection or cybersecurity standards beyond compliance with BIS, CE, and ISO 10218-1, potentially leaving security gaps.\n",
            "• Liability for damage or loss during unloading is subject to joint inspection, which may result in ambiguity or disputes over responsibility.\n",
